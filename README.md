# Carteira-Aleatoria
Experiment to see if a randow portifolio can beat the IBOVESPA (B3) or other investiment funds in  Brazil.

There are quite a few research on the return of a randow portifolio and it capacite to beat the market, this is my own experiment where a simulate a total of 6
portifolios with 5 different companies, where 3 have no restrictions on which type of company we may buy, and the other 3 have a 5 randomized industry sector
and for each randomized sector we pick a randow stock.
